# Unsolicited Advice

## Overview
Can't hold your tongue? Chomping at the bit to add your two cents (or two thousand)? Restless to inundate those around you with instruction they never requested? Incapable of just listening and validating? Want to be a good friend, partner, coworker, or family member, but feel that you'll spontaneously combust if you don't tell others how to live their lives?

Enter Unsolicited Advice.

Unsolicited Advice was created for people who indeed want to be better at supporting, but just can't seem to shut the hell up. Instead of force-feeding your unsought, wayward counsel down the throats of those around you, post it to Unsolicited Advice, a giant repository where overbearing folks just like you post their unwanted guidance so their relationships can flourish.

Be nice, use Unsolicited Advice.

## Objectives + Core Features
Unsolicited Advice acts as a repository for unwanted guidance. As a user, I can:

1. Immediately be directed to a home landing page, where I can read about Unsolicited Advice, what it is, and what it does.

2. Click the navigation button for "All The Shit Advice" and be directed to a page containing all the advice submissions on a single page. This page will render without refreshing, using client-side routing.

3. Utilize the search bar on the "All The Shit Advice" page, typing in a keyword that will filter through the database based on the "advice" key's value.

4. Click the link in the Nav Bar and be directed to the "Add Your Shit" page. This page will also render without refreshing, using client-side routing.

5. Add my own unsolicited advice by inputting the following fields:
    - Category/Theme
    - Recipient Relation
    - Advice
The advice will then be added to database, thus being rendered when I navigate to the "All The Shit Advice" page.

## Bonus Objective:

6. If after adding my own unsolicited advice, I still have the unbearable urge to spew my self-declared enlightenment at others, I can head to the bottom of the page and click "Generate Advice" button, which will provide me with a randomized sage quote from a famous figure via an external API, because it is better to regurgitate a blanket-statement from Ghandi than tell someone how to live their lives.
